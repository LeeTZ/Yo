Yo is a user-friendly programming language for movie production. It offers a convenient way to do non-linear video editing by a few lines of scripts. Users can produce videos from varieties of sources such as images or existing video clips and apply system- or user-defined functions to perform seamless video editing such as clip construction, duration adjustment, subtitle burning. In this light, Yo's objective is to facilitate editing on videos and to reduce human effort involved in production.
